# Project Plan: LangVoice
This document outlines the high-level development plan and milestones for the LangVoice project. It serves as a guide for the development team to ensure a structured and efficient workflow.

## Development Workflow

We will follow a standard Git-based workflow:

1.  **Branching Strategy:**
    -   `main`: Production-ready code. Only merged from `develop` via pull requests.
    -   `develop`: Integration branch for new features. All feature branches are merged into `develop`.
    -   `feature/<feature-name>`: Branches for new features. Created from `develop`.
    -   `bugfix/<bug-description>`: Branches for bug fixes. Created from `main` or `develop` depending on urgency.
    -   `hotfix/<hotfix-description>`: Branches for critical production bug fixes. Created from `main`.

2.  **Pull Requests (PRs):**
    -   All code changes must go through a PR review process.
    -   PRs should have clear descriptions, link to relevant tasks, and include testing instructions.
    -   At least one approval is required before merging.

3.  **Code Reviews:**
    -   Focus on code quality, adherence to coding standards, and functional correctness.
    -   Provide constructive feedback.

4.  **Testing:**
    -   Developers are responsible for unit testing their code.
    -   Integration testing will be performed before merging to `develop`.
    -   Manual testing will be conducted on staging environments.
